1. Assume that the api is hosted on another server.
  Access it using a http request
  
3. Use server side rendering. It is good for SEO and performance. It still renders the app even if client side js is disabled

4. In order to support full ES5 features and jsx, I need to transpile server side code with babel-loader.
  Install babel-node and create .babelrc file.
  Setup the script to run "nodemon --exec babel-node server.js --ignore public/"
